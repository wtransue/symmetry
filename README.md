# Molecular Symmetry

This resource is meant to be a more mathematical approach for learning about symmetry, group theory, representation theory, and the irreducible tensor method for molecular point groups. 
These concepts will be developed in the context of electronic structure (ligand field theory), spectroscopy, and magnetism. 

## Other Resources

There are several fantastic resources on symmetry in chemistry, such as the textbooks listed below. 

1. Miessler, Fisher, and Tarr 
2. Harris and Bertolucci 
3. Butler 
4. Cotton 
5. Etc. 

There are additionally several online resources: 

1. SymOtter 
2. Gernot Katzer 
3. Etc. 

If there are other resources that should be added to this list, please share them with me.
