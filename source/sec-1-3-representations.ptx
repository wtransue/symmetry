  <p>
    A group is a collection of symmetry operations, and we have established that we use matrix representatives to express each symmetry operation. 
    The easiest way to introduce a "group representation" (or often just "representation") is as a set of matrix representatives, one for each operation. 
    For example, a representation for the <m>\mathcal{C}_{2v}</m> point group could be

      \left\{ 
        \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{E}, 
        \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} -1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{C_2}, 
        \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{\sigma_{xz}}, 
        \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix} -1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}}_{\sigma_{yz}}, 
      \right\}
