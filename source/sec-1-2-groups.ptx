  <title>Groups and Point Groups</title>

  <p>
    Groups are an extension of a more familiar concept: sets. 
    A group is a set equipped with some notion of "multiplication" between the elements. 
  </p>

  <p> 
    There are two kinds of groups commonly encountered by chemists: point groups and space groups. 
    A point group is a collection of symmetry operations that leave at least one point unmoved. 
    A space groups additionally considers translational symmetry operations. 
    Point groups are used in molecular systems and space groups are used in crystal systems. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We will deal only with point groups. 
    After we establish molecular symmetries in a purely spatial context, we will introduce spin in the next chapter and turn to the use of so-called "double groups".
