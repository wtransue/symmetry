      Technically, the application of an external magnetic field has a huge consequence on the symmetry of the system. 
      A magnetic field itself has its own direction; this may or may not be aligned with the principal rotation axis, so it has the potential to dramatically lower the symmetry of the system. 
      Additionally, the magnetic field is a pseudovector so it transforms like rotations. 
      At its core, a magnetic field causes descent to an abelian group, breaking all degeneracy. 
      This is summarized in the following table: (no field vs field along principal axis vs field at skew angle) 
      Several of these point groups are actually unique to systems in the presence of a magnetic field (e.g. K).

    <p>
      Luckily, we generally think about a magnetic field as a small perturbation to our system. 
      This is because the influence of magnetism is generally weak.
