  <title>Irreducible Tensor Methods</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have now established how to describe molecular symmetry using the tools of group and representation theory. 
      We can now assign functions to specific irreps of the point group to figure out how they transfer under various symmetry operations. 
      A big question now arises: what can we do with that info? 
      In this chapter, we will discuss what happens when we multiply functions together, and we'll establish how to predict the symmetry(ies) of the product.
