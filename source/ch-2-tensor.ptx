  <title>Irreducible Tensor Methods</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      A major application of molecular symmetry is in the prediction and understanding of molecular electronic structure. 
      We will begin with application of group theory in the construction of single-electron molecular orbitals. 
      We will then review multielectron atomic theory before expanding those concepts to apply to transition metal complexes.
