  <title>Symmetry Elements and Symmetry Operations</title>

  <p>
    The symmetry operations in a three-dimensional space are typically classified as one of the five following types: identity, reflection, inversion, rotation, and improper rotation. 
    Each symmetry operation can be expressed using a "matrix representative", a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix that acts on any point in Cartesian space. 
  </p>

  <p> 
    Any three-dimensional symmetry operation can be represented as a (proper) rotation <m>C_n</m> or an improper rotation <m>S_n</m>. 
    An improper rotation can be conceptualized as a proper rotation followed by a reflection through a plane normal to the axis of rotation. 
  </p>

  <p>
    When we hunt for symmetry operations of a molecule, we think only of the nuclear positions. 
    The patterns of distributions of electrons will be treated later using representation theory. 
    For example, in analysis of benzene, we do not need to think about the Ï€ cloud of electron density split above and below the plane of the molecule; instead, we focus only on how the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms are interchanged by the symmetry operations.
