  <title>Symmetry and Group Theory</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This resource is designed for chemistry graduate students who are seeking a more mathematical approach to learning about point groups and group theory. 
      We assume the reader has taken inorganic chemistry and the quantum portion of physical chemistry, both at an undergraduate level. 
      We also assume familiarity with basic multivariate calculus, basic linear algebra, and with the main conclusions of chemistry group theoretic concepts. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Because we are not aiming to be a student's first exposure to group theory and its applications in chemistry, it is prudent for us to outline a few particularly useful and/or popular resources. 
      Here are a few:

          Resource 2

          Resource 3
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This first chapter is designed to provide a refresher on the "molecular" point groups and their representations. 
      Once we reach representation theory, we generally follow the treatise "Group Theory in Spectroscopy with Applications in Magnetic Circular Dichroism" by Drs. Susan B. Piepho and Paul N. Schatz, a fantastic resource that appears to be out of print.
